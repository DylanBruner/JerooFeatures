# JerooFeatures
bookmarklet doesnt work as of now because of githubs mime type i might fix this 


<h1>Features</h1>

1. Execute javascript
2. Play a boom sound effect jeroo_name.playBoomSound() note make sure to create a method named playBoomSound or else it will fail
3. playSound()//url=<direct_mp3_url> only audio files will work!!
